# The Go Programming Language

This repository presents a set of programs written in the Go programming language, collected from different references. That allow the reader to quickly introduce themselves to the basic and concurrent elements of the language.

The reader can run each of the programs by simply copying and pasting the source code at https://play.golang.org/ without installing any software on their computer.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of references on which the collection of the programs was based. Same that can be useful for a deeper reading. The first reference, McGabreb 2019, can be very helpful in quickly gaining confidence and practice in using the Go programming language. While the second reference, Balbaert 2012, can be useful to answer much deeper questions.
